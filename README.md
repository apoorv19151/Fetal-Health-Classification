# Fetal Health Classification

* Trained a model to predict the health of a fetus as 1) Normal, 2) Suspect or 3) Pathological using CTG data.
* Used Decision Tree Classifier for training and performed hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV, trained a model that predicted fetal health with an accuracy of 95%.
* Used metrics like precision, recall, f1-score and AUC-ROC curve to evaluate the performance of the model.
